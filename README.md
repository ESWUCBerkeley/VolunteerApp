# Welcome!
We are Engineers for a Sustainable World, a student organization at UC Berkeley. Our goal as an organization is to motivate top engineering students to work on projects that improve the local communities as well as building general awareness and technological solutions to sustainability. 
## Project Details
The Volunteer App will focus on connecting people to local volunteering opportunities. We will require code for both the back end and front end. We will decide on the programming language later, though Java and Swift are required for Android and iOS respectively. 
## Commits
I havenâ€™t decided yet whether to use separate branches and then committing or committing directly. I am thinking that the latter is better for new projects as merge conflicts will not be severe. 
## Git Tutorial
Quick breakdown of git. 
## Technical Information
We will update this section later for technical aspects of this app.
## Communication
Please notify Yifeng Ding (yding02, yd@berkeley.edu) if you have any questions.
